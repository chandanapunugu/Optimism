    </b> What if we hung back and faced our fears. What if there is a way to help people with optimism?<br />
    My friend once said to me,<br />
    <b>
      <u>
        “ Optimism is like a tree. When you give a tree a compliment it grows but when someone cuts it down it feels sad
        and depressed.” <br />
      </u>
      <u>

      </u>
    </b>
    Listening to my friend’s words, I sometimes question myself. What if the world was without optimism and how do we
    spread optimism?<br />
    I believe that we should let the negative pass and have a positive outcome in the future.We can start a chain
    reaction, spread it, and pay it forward.<br />

  </P>
  <P>
    What if we let ourselves down, then we can’t spread optimism around the world like a chain reaction. <br />
    Like Neil Armstrong once said,<br />
    <b>
      <u>
        “That one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.” <br />
      </u>
    </b>
    This quote inspired many people to be optimistic in many ways and told people to fill the world with
    positivity.<br />
    Some people are pessimistic and don’t have a lot of positivity But if they increase the positivity rate it can
    envelop the world into a better place<br />
    . This is why people can change the world.<br />

  </P>
  <P>
    For example, the one time when my mind was filled with negativity was when I was in third grade and we had a math
    pre-test.<br />
    When I was done with the pre-test I thought that I had got a ninety on the pretest but when I got the results,<br />
    I had got a thirty three percent. I was let down by my grade. But my teacher, the most optimistic person in the
    world,<br />
    as she would guide anyone who had a hard time, guided me as well and found ways to make me believe in myself.<br />
    She advised me to learn from my mistakes and improvise. In the words of Micheal Jordan, <br />
    “Always turn a negative situation into a positive situation.” <br />
    That was exactly what I wanted to do in my life.<br />

  </P>
  <p>
    After reading such quotes and after my third-grade incident<br />
    , I promised myself that I would never let negative thoughts<br />
    get in my way. Because, If I am pessimistic and have a<br />
    bad attitude myself, which may have a ripple effect<br />
    on others, how will I be able to bring about the change in the world?<br />

  </p>
  <P>

    For some people they have a bad attitude and are pessimistic.<br />
    They are lonely, sad, and depressed. But what if I tell you<br />
    that we can change pessimism and optimism? What if there are<br />
    endless possibilities to make them optimistic?<br />
    One way that we can be optimistic and envelop <br />
    the world is to spread it like a wildfire or <br />
    like atoms. We can start a chain reaction to <br />
    let other people make other people around <br />
    them have a better and happier life. <br />

  </P>
  <p>
    We can start a chain reaction of making one’s life become<br/> better, and they in turn would make another’s life
      better,<br />
    and this way spreads the message of making the whole world<br />
    a better place to live with optimism.

  </p>
  <p>
    In conclusion, I believe that we can change the world with positivity in many different ways, <br />
    like you can spread it and you could also potentially say it and make an action out of it. <br />
    You should also be positive instead of negative because then we can impact the world with<br />
    our actions. We should also have a positive outcome in the future.<br />
    Helen Keller led a life of optimism in spite of her physical disabilities of blindness,<br />
    dumbness and deafness and in fact became an author, a speaker and an example fo<br />
    r many who lead a handicapped life. <br />
