    <H1>How To Change The World With Optimism</H1>
   <P>
    “How to change the world with optimism.” What if we hung back and faced our fears. What if there is a way to help people with optimism?
     My friend once said to me, “ Optimism is like a tree. When you give a tree a compliment it grows but when someone cuts it down it feels sad and depressed.”
      Listening to my friend’s  words, I sometimes question myself. What if the world was without optimism and how do we spread optimism?
       I believe that we should let the negative pass and have a positive outcome in the future.We can start a chain reaction, spread it, and pay it forward.

    What if we let ourselves down, then we can’t spread optimism around the world like a chain reaction. 
    Like Neil Armstrong once said, “That one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.”
     This quote inspired many people to be optimistic in many ways and told people to fill the world with positivity.
      Some people are pessimistic and don’t have a lot of positivity. But if they increase the positivity rate it can envelop the world into a better place
      . This is why people can change the world.

    some people they have a bad attitude and are pessimistic. They are lonely, sad, and depressed. But what if I tell you that we can change pessimism and optimism?
     What if there are endless possibilities to make them optimistic? One way that we can be optimistic and envelop the world is to spread it like a wildfire or like atoms.
      We can start a chain reaction to let other people make other people around them have a better and happier life.
